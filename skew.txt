skew Join : it scans the data ,it detects keys with large skew,instead of  processing those keys,it stores temporarly in hdfs directory.
	   in map reduce job process those skewed keys.,the same key need not be skew for all the tables and map reduce job is faster 

  Example : for both table and b,has skewed data 'mytest',assume b has less rows,

            step 1 --> scan  b and save all rows with the key mytest in-memory hash table,
	    Step2  --> run set of mappers to read table A ,if it has skewd key 'mytest',it wil use hashed version of b for the join
 	    Step 3 --> other keys send rows to a reducer to perform join,the same reducer will get rows from the mappers that scannign table B
