Analytic functions:

Row_Number: Row number is hive analytic function is used to assign unique values to each rows within group based on the column values used in OVER clause.

Rank: Get rank of the rows in column or within group.Rows with equal values recieve same rank and the rank value is skipped.,rank analytic function is used in top 'n' analysis.


Dense_rank: Dense Rank Hive function returns the rank of a value in a group.rows with equal values for ranking criteria reiceve the same rank and assign rank in sequential order i.e no rank values are skipped.the rank analytic function is used in top n analysis.

Command:
select pat_id, dept_id, ins_amt, row_number() over (order by ins_amt) as rn, rank() over (order by ins_amt ) as rk, 
dense_rank() over (order by ins_amt ) as dense_rk from patient;

pat_id	dept_id	ins_amt	rn	rk	dense_rk
8	444	10000	1	1	1
5	111	50000	2	2	2
6	111	90000	3	3	3
1	111	100000	4	4	4
7	333	110000	5	5	5
2	111	150000	6	6	6
3	222	150000	7	6	6
4	222	250000	8	8	7
5	222	890000	9	9	8


cume_dist: CUME_DIST is analytic function that returns the cumulative distribution of a given row,it computes the relative position of a specified value in a group of values.
The range of values returned by cume_dist is >0 to <= 1



percent_rank: calculates the relative rank of a row within the group of rows.
 PERCENT_RANK ranks a value by calculating its rank minus 1 (rk - 1), and dividing that value by the number of rows in the partition minus 1 (nr - 1). For each row in a partition PERCENT_RANK returns (rk -1) / (nr - 1). A float value between 0 and 1 is returned which represents a percentage.




Ntile:NTILE is an analytic function. It divides an ordered data set into a number of buckets indicated by expr and assigns the appropriate bucket number to each row. The buckets are numbered 1 through expr .
